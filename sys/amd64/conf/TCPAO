# TCPAO -- GENERIC FreeBSD kernel with support for TCP-AO (RFC 5925)
#
# This file is not intended to be committed to upstream FreeBSD.
# It exists only for convenience during development.
#
# Note that on CURRENT this configuration does not disable any invasive
# debugging options.  This configuration alone should not be used for
# performance testing.

include	GENERIC
ident	TCPAO

# GENERIC includes 'options IPSEC_SUPPORT' and 'device crypto'.
# This alone suffices.
